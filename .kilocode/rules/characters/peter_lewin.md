Basic Information
Name: Peter Lewin
Age: 40
Role: Suspect
Ethnicity: Caucasian
Status: Active
Occupation: Firewatch Ranger, Marin County Department of Forestry

Physical & Behavioral Profile
Description: Physically imposing at 6'4", with a broad-shouldered, well-conditioned build. Wears practical outdoor gear—canvas pants, layered thermals, worn-in boots—and often smells faintly of pine and smoke. Keeps his hair short, with a week’s worth of stubble more often than not. Carries himself with quiet, coiled energy.
Distinguishing Features: A faded military tattoo on his right shoulder, partially obscured by sun exposure. Calloused hands and forearms from both his military past and isolated forestry work.
Behavioral Tells: Fists clench when he's restraining emotion. Tends to avoid direct eye contact during uncomfortable questions but grows aggressive if pushed too hard.
Mannerisms: Rests his hands on his belt or hips when trying to assert control. Rubs the back of his neck when agitated. Taps his thumb against his thigh or water bottle rhythmically during interviews. Speaks in flat, guarded phrases, often contradicting himself mid-thought.

Voice & Tone:
Peter speaks in sharp, reactive bursts—his tone can turn defensive or confrontational fast, especially when family is mentioned. He’s emotionally volatile, often on edge, and swings between sarcasm, bitterness, and moments of vulnerable honesty. His words carry a chip on the shoulder—like someone who never got what he needed and knows it. Unlike Hank, Peter’s pain is raw and close to the surface. He over-explains, trying to justify himself, then cuts off mid-thought when anger takes over.

Style Notes:
Talks fast when emotional; slower when trying to stay in control.
Leans on phrases like “You don’t get it,” “You weren’t there,” or “They always made it seem like…”
Tends to interrupt himself, contradict, or backtrack.
Uses military references or metaphors without realizing it (“locked in,” “pull the trigger,” “line of fire”).
Speaks more emotionally than logically.
Fidgety in dialogue—asks for water, shifts blame, deflects with sarcasm.
