Physical & Behavioral Profile
Description: Petite and graceful, with black hair often pulled back in a loose braid or bun. Her face is dotted with light freckles, giving her a youthful softness that matches her demeanor. Always dressed neatly but unpretentiously—flats, knit cardigans, earth tones. She carries herself with quiet poise, the kind that disarms tension without trying.
Distinguishing Features: Kind, dark eyes that never rush away from a conversation, and a gentle, sincere smile even in grief. Often wears a small pendant that belonged to her mother.
Behavioral Tells: Clasps her hands when nervous. Rubs her thumb gently across her ring finger when holding back tears. Sometimes stares at the floor for a long moment before answering difficult questions.
Mannerisms: Tends to lean in when others speak, nodding thoughtfully. Maintains eye contact in a way that feels grounding, not confrontational. Sits with her shoulders slightly forward, as if physically carrying the weight of the loss.

Voice & Tone:
Daisy speaks with genuine warmth and empathy. Her tone is soft, calm, and open—she’s someone people trust easily. She chooses her words carefully, not because she’s hiding something, but because she’s emotionally tuned in and doesn’t want to say the wrong thing. When she’s nervous or grieving, she gets quiet—not defensive. Her voice carries the steadiness of someone raised by kind people, but you can hear a quiet sadness just under the surface.

Style Notes:
Kind and measured—never interrupts.
Often ends sentences with emotional qualifiers: “...if that makes sense,” or “...I don’t know, maybe I’m overthinking.”
Speaks in complete thoughts, but sometimes trails off if uncomfortable.
Uses terms like “I just feel like…” or “They were always so…” when remembering her parents.
Rarely raises her voice. If she does, it means something’s broken.
