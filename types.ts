/**
 * @file types.ts
 * @description This file contains all the core type definitions and interfaces used throughout the application.
 * It serves as the single source of truth for the data structures that model the story, characters, objects, and UI state.
 *
 * @architectural_pattern
 * The data model is designed around a **Component-Based Architecture**. Instead of creating monolithic `Character` or
 * `StoryObject` interfaces with dozens of optional properties, we use a flexible `components` array. Each item in
 * this array is a `DataComponent`, which is a self-contained, typed piece of data (e.g., a character's social media feed,
 * an object's purchase history).
 *
 * @pattern_benefits
 * - **Scalability:** To add a new type of clue or interaction (e.g., "email records"), a developer only needs to define
 *   a new props interface (e.g., `EmailProps`) and a new data component type (`{ type: 'email', props: ... } `). No
 *   changes are needed to the core `Character` or `StoryObject` types.
 * - **Decoupling:** The UI can be built to dynamically render features based on the `components` a character has.
 *   This prevents a tight coupling between the data structure and the presentation layer.
 * - **Maintainability:** Data is organized logically. Instead of a flat, confusing object, data is grouped by its
 *   functional domain, making it easier to read, understand, and debug.
