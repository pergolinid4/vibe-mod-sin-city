/**
 * @file config.ts
 * @description Centralized configuration file for the application.
 *
 * @architectural_decision
 * This file serves as a single source of truth for various constants used throughout the application.
 * Centralizing configuration offers several key benefits:
 * 1.  **Maintainability:** Game balancing variables (like thresholds), API settings, and UI constants
 *     are easy for developers to find and modify without hunting through multiple files.
 * 2.  **Scalability:** As the application grows, new configuration values can be added here, keeping
 *     the codebase organized.
 * 3.  **Clarity:** It provides a clear overview of the application's tunable parameters.
