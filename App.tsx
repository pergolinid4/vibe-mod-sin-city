/**
 * @file App.tsx
 * @description This file serves as the root of the React application. It embodies several key architectural patterns
 * for a scalable and maintainable frontend.
 *
 * @architectural_overview
 * 1.  **Centralized Layout Composition:** `App.tsx` is responsible for composing the main visual structure of the app,
 *     including the primary content area (`GameScreen`), the navigation (`NavBar`). The global AI assistant button (`ADAFab`) has been removed
 *     to create a more focused experience for the current version.
 *
 * 2.  **State-Driven Modal System:** The component implements a powerful and flexible modal system. Instead of having
 *     components directly toggle modal visibility, they dispatch a `showModal` action to the Redux store with a `type`
 *     and `props`. This `App` component listens to the `activeModal` state and uses a `MODAL_COMPONENTS` registry
 *     (a simple object map) to render the correct modal component with the correct props.
 *
 * @pattern_benefits
 * -   **Decoupling:** Components that trigger modals (e.g., `CharacterCard`) don't need to know about the modal's
 *     implementation details. They only need to know the modal's `type` and what `props` it expects.
 * -   **Scalability:** Adding a new modal to the application is trivial. A developer simply creates the new modal
 *     component, imports it here, and adds a single line to the `MODAL_COMPONENTS` registry. No other part of the
 *     application needs to change.
 * -   **Centralized Control:** All modal presentations are handled in one place, making it easy to manage and debug
 *     modal behavior globally.
