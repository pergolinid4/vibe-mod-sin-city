Tom had been shot through the heart with a .243 Winchester; Carol’s body was discovered at the base of a nearby cliff.\nInitial investigation suggests Tom was shot using a high-powered hunting rifle, and Carol fell while fleeing the scene. The case reveals a complex web of resentments, betrayals, and financial disputes, all tied to the recent sale of the family’s outdoor shop, Wild Trail Supply Co.",

// --- Data Transformation Layer ---
// This is a critical architectural pattern. The functions below transform the "author-friendly"

// This separation allows story writers to work with a simple structure without needing to know
// the final data model in detail, while the application benefits from a robust and predictable
// data contract.

/**
 * Transforms the raw character data into the structured `Character` format.
 * - Extracts statements into a separate `testimonies` collection for normalization.
 * - **Auto-generates** a `file` component containing a `mugshot` based on physical characteristics.
 * - **Standardizes** the data by ensuring every character has a consistent set of `DataComponent`s,
 *   even if they are empty. This prevents countless null checks in the UI components.
 * @param {any[]} rawCharacters - The array of raw character objects from the story.
 * @param {any[]} allRawObjects - A mutable reference to the full list of objects, allowing this function to add new ones (like mugshots).
 * @param {Testimony[]} testimonies - An accumulator array to which testimony data will be added.
 * @returns {Character[]} An array of processed `Character` objects ready for the Redux store.
