Physical & Behavioral Profile
Description: Lean with a long, narrow face and unnaturally pale skin. 
Wears sleek, branded outdoor gear—performance fabrics, pristine boots, and tactical accessories more for image than function. His black hair is slicked back with deliberate care, and he sports a thin, well-maintained mustache.
Distinguishing Features: Faded, uneven tattoos run up both arms and across his chest—cheap-looking script, animal silhouettes, and cryptic symbols that clash with his influencer persona. Often seen with mirrored sunglasses and a GoPro harness.
Behavioral Tells: Keeps strong eye contact to dominate conversation. Constantly adjusts his sleeves or collar when things get tense. Can turn to rage at the drop of a hat.
Mannerisms: Rehearsed charisma—wide gestures, performative empathy, carefully timed chuckles. Overuses his hands when talking, especially when trying to appear sincere or grounded.

Voice & Tone:
Oliver speaks with charm, control, and calculation. He’s quick with a smile and quicker with a jab—his words are smooth on the surface but often cutting underneath. He knows how to read people and shape the conversation to his advantage. When confronted, he doesn’t get flustered—he deflects, mocks, or flips the narrative. Everything he says is laced with a subtle undercurrent of “you’re not as smart as you think.” He’s manipulative, persuasive, and emotionally slippery.

Style Notes:
Confident and articulate, sometimes smug.
Uses sarcasm and passive aggression as defense.
Enjoys turning questions back on the interrogator.
Poses rhetorical questions and hypothetical statements to dodge direct answers.
Never gives more than he has to—unless it’ll unnerve you.
Can shift from charming to vicious mid-sentence if pushed.
