Physical & Behavioral Profile
Description: Lean and wiry, with deeply tanned, weathered skin from decades of exposure. His white hair is knotted into long, uneven dreadlocks, and his beard is even longer—more like a tangled veil than a grooming choice. Wears layered clothing in clashing colors: ripped thermals, dusty hiking pants, and patched jackets that smell faintly of smoke.
Distinguishing Features: Piercing gray eyes that dart between focus and vacancy. His hands are nicked and stained from years of foraging, smoking, and tinkering. Often barefoot or in shredded boots. A necklace of carved bones and beads hangs beneath his shirt.
Behavioral Tells: Talks to himself under his breath, even during conversation. Tilts his head sharply when he senses someone lying or holding something back. Will suddenly grow still and stare into the distance as if listening to something no one else hears.
Mannerisms: Gestures wide and theatrically when making a point, often with both hands. Rocks slightly on his heels when standing still. Keeps small objects—stones, feathers, string—in his pockets and fidgets with them constantly. May pause mid-sentence to chase a bird away, swat at nothing, or whisper a warning no one asked for.

Voice & Tone:
Kermit speaks in rambling, disjointed sentences, often laced with wild metaphors, non-sequiturs, or backwoods superstitions. He’s seen as eccentric—maybe even unstable—but every now and then, he’ll say something startlingly lucid or wise. His tone shifts between muttering and sudden, intense clarity. He often refers to people by vague nicknames (“the tall one,” “the loud son”), and rarely answers a question directly.

Style Notes:
Mix of poetic nonsense and eerie insight.
Uses animal metaphors, trail talk, or old folklore.
Might burst into laughter mid-thought, or go dead serious when least expected.
Frequently avoids eye contact and talks to himself even when others are present.
Speaks in riddles, but when focused, can give shockingly accurate descriptions.
