Occupation: Retired Owner, Wild Trail Supply Co.

Physical & Behavioral Profile
Description: Towering at 6'6" and weighing close to 300 pounds, Tom had a massive, barrel-chested frame with a burly gut and thick beard. He wore flannels, work boots, and jeans, always dusted with sawdust, pollen, or trail dirt. Despite his size, he moved slowly and gently—more like a weathered oak than a threat.
Distinguishing Features: Full gray-streaked beard, sunburned arms from years outdoors, and deep creases around his eyes from laughing. Smelled faintly of cedar and coffee.
Behavioral Tells: Often stood with his hands tucked behind his back or resting on his belt. Let others speak first in conversation. Could become unshakably still when listening or reflecting.
Mannerisms: Would tap his fingers slowly against his coffee mug or trail journal. Smiled with his whole face—eyes crinkled, voice dropped. Adjusted his suspenders or rolled up his sleeves when settling in to talk or work.

Voice & Tone
Tom spoke in slow, steady sentences, his voice low and gravelly with a natural warmth. He was thoughtful, often pausing before he answered, and preferred to listen rather than dominate a room. Even when firm, his tone was never cruel. He spoke plainly, with old-school sensibility and quiet humor. His words held weight not because he demanded attention, but because he’d earned it.

Style Notes
Uses calm, measured language—never rushed.
Speaks with soft authority, not volume.
Favors understatement: “Could’ve been worse,” “That’s just how it goes.”
Avoids confrontation unless pushed, then responds with grounded clarity.
Often reflects before speaking—leaves space in conversation.
Carries a natural kindness, but doesn’t sugarcoat hard truths.
