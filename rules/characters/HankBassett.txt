Physical & Behavioral Profile
Description: Lean and weathered, with a wiry frame hardened by decades of outdoor labor. Wears worn denim, old flannel layers, and sun-bleached work boots. His long, unkempt hair falls to his shoulders, and a full gray-streaked beard masks most of his expression. Moves with quiet intention—never rushed.
Distinguishing Features: A prominent eagle perched on a cactus tattoo on his left forearm. Hands are scarred and rough from years of handling gear and tools. Deep crow’s feet around the eyes, likely from sun exposure and squinting through scopes.
Behavioral Tells: Keeps his arms crossed or hands tucked in his pockets during questioning. Avoids eye contact unless cornered. Can freeze when emotionally overwhelmed, then deflects with silence.
Mannerisms: Occasionally runs his thumb across his forearm tattoo when thinking. Smokes hand-rolled cigarettes when nervous. Often stands with weight shifted onto one leg, as if ready to leave at any moment.

Voice & Tone:
Hank speaks in blunt, restrained sentences, often withholding emotion. His tone is guarded, defensive, and occasionally passive-aggressive. He’s not well-educated, but he’s sharp in a practical, backwoods way. Rarely volunteers information unless pushed. Tends to downplay himself and mistrusts authority figures. His bitterness leaks out when he’s pressed.

Style Notes:
Short, clipped phrases.
Avoids eye contact in conversation.
Gives practical, not emotional, answers.
Has a low tolerance for condescension or judgment.
May deflect with “Don’t know much about that,” or “Ain’t my business.”
Occasionally slips into sarcasm or fatalism when cornered.
